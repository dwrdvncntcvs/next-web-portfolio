# Edward Vincent's Website Portfolio

This is a project I built serve as my portfolio. This website firstly built with **_[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)_**, **_[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)_**,and **_[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)_** and hosted at **_[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)_**. I really like the library and how I wrote code with it to create components, hooks, and some other concepts built with the library. I do like the concept of creating multiple components and building them together to create a single page application. However, I want to implement SEO for my website portfolio so it will appear in Google Search Engine.

I did search some concepts of implementing SEO in ReactJS applications but mostly says that it is hard to implement SEO in ReactJS and it is much better and easier if you create your application with **_[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)_**.

This application was the second iteration of my website portfolio project and this time I built this with **_NextJS_** and **_Firebase_**.

_Note: This application is still in development._
